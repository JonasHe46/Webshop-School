Here is a small overview of my website. :slightly_smiling_face:

- [ ] better way to check login and logout
- [ ] no more PHP and mysql
- [ ] Python Rest APi
- [ ] works on all devices (responsive)
- [ ] Add email address to account and send confirmation.
- [ ] Send order confirmation as email

Let's start with the home page!

The categories and products come from a database. Javascript displays them dynamically.

The shopping cart looks like this.

Here we have a working login. The data is also retrieved from the database.

Where there is a login, there must be a register.

There are a few other nice little things but this is what it is. :)
